# New:
I've started [documenting](./apple-pascal-notes.md) my exploration of the Apple II Pascal p-code runtimes.

# Projects here:

[BBoot](https://github.com/chris-e-green/b-boot) - an ancient DOS boot sector (in 80x86 assembler) to allow booting from the second floppy drive

[DirStat](https://github.com/chris-e-green/dirstat) - an ancient DOS program (in Turbo Pascal) to display disk usage

[NFormat](https://github.com/chris-e-green/nformat) - an ancient DOS program (in Turbo Pascal) to make the FORMAT command safer

[ShftLock](https://github.com/chris-e-green/shftlock) - an ancient DOS TSR (in 80x86 assembler) to make a keyboard behave like a typewriter. For youngsters, typewriter shift keys weren't the same as computer caps-lock keys, because they literally 'shifted' the rack of letters up. The result was that not only were letters in capitals, but every other key also behaved as if shift was being pressed (eg, when shift-lock was on, typing '8' produced a *). Typists who came from traditional typewriters, as well as those who came from 'professional' word-processing computers, found generic computer keyboards awkward to use. This TSR was designed to address that issue.

[StarSystems](https://github.com/chris-e-green/star-systems) - a utility (written in Swift) to generate Traveller(TM) star systems using the classic rules plus book 6 (Scouts), with support for some variants. Can produce hand-crafted PDF subsector maps.
