# Apple II Pascal notes
In an effort to fill an (apparent) gap 
in the available information on the behaviour
of the various Apple II Pascal p-machine 
implementations,
I have been progressively pulling apart and
deciphering the different flavours. 

So that the information I work out isn't lost,
I plan to document what I find here. 

To date, I've been able to locate:

- version 1.0 (64k, developer)
- version 1.1 (64k, developer)
- version 1.1 (48k, runtime)
- version 1.2 (64k, developer)
- version 1.2 (128k, developer)
- version 1.3 (64k, developer)
- version 1.3 (128k, developer)
